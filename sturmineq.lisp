;;; OPEN-INTERVAL-UNIV-INEQ (c): Given a conjunction of the form:
;;;
;;;  (< P 0) /\ (> x a) /\ (< x b) ..., 
;;;
;;; with P a univariate polynomial in Q[x], decide whether or not P is satisfiable
;;; over the open interval (a,b).  Our algorithm works as follows:
;;;
;;;  (1) Count how many real roots P has in the *closed* interval [a,b] using
;;;      a Sturm sequence calculation,
;;;  (2) Subtract the number of roots there are on the boundary points a and b,
;;;  (3) If the result is 0, then P does not change sign in (a,b).
;;;  (4) So, we pick a sample point in (a,b), (a+b)/2, and then evaluate P at this
;;;      point.  If P( (a+b)/2 ) satisfies the inequality, then we return this
;;;      as a witness of satisfiability.  If P( (a+b)/2 ) does not satisfy the
;;;      inequality, then we return UNSAT.
;;;
;;;  We assume the RHS of the main inequality is 0.
