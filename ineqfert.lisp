;;; FERTILIZE-TRIVIAL-SQUARES (c): Given a conjunction, return the result of conjoining
;;; a constraint (>= p 0) for each polynomial in c that is a trivial square (e.g. every
;;; variable in every power-product has even degree, every monomial coefficient is non-neg).  
;;; We also keep track of context here, and *if* we are inside a cojunct that is proclaiming 
;;; (< p 0), we return :UNSAT (:UNSAT-WITNESS (< p 0) (>= p 0)) if p is a trivial square.
;;;
;;; Note: All polynomials are canonicalized in the process.  This is expensive (e.g. O(nm)).  
;;; Perhaps I will try and cache such a thing in the future.  In the mean time, I will just 
;;; remain aware of this fact during waterfall construction.
;;;
;;; Adjusted to recognize negated trivial squares:
;;;   e.g., we now recognize that (> (* (-1) P) 0), where P is SOS, is unsat.
