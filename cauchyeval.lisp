(in-package RAHD)

;;;
;;; Given a rational x, is its nth root a rational?  If so, we return it.
;;; If not, we return nil.
;;;
;;; Note: We return only `positive' roots (e.g. if n is even).
;;;
;;; Updated on 14-Nov-2008 using an excellent suggestion of Paul Jackson:
;;;  Since (p/q)^n = (p^n / q^n), and floating point representations of 
;;;  rational numbers require denominators to be powers of 2, we can get
;;;  much better coverage by computing (p^n)^(1/n) and (q^n)^(1/n) separately,
;;;  and then can combine them as ((p/q)^n)^(1/n) = ((p^n)^(1/n) / (q^n)^(1/n)).
;;;  Now, we only use floating point representations of integers, whose denom's
;;;  are trivially powers of 2!
