;;; Note that these functions are able to operate with all 
;;;  ordered-ring predicates: {=,<,>,<=,>=}, not just
;;;  equations and strict inequalities like most of the RAHD
;;;  CMFs.  This is because we wish interval constraint
;;;  propagation to be used even at the top *G* goal level
;;;  before non-strict expansion.
