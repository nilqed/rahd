;;; Note: We have now added a ``generic'' mode for interfacing with QEPCAD.
;;;  This mode is for semialgebraic sets that are not a priori known to be
;;;  open.  In this case, we cannot use the EX-INF-MANY relaxation, and just
;;;  do straight-forward CAD.
;;;

;;;
;;; Given an open conjunction, produce an EX-INF relaxation of the problem
;;; as a string in QEPCAD-B notation.
;;;
;;; If generic is T, then we do generic CAD instead of EX-INF relaxation.
