;;; INTEGRAL-DOMAIN-ZERO-PRODUCT-BRANCH: Given a case, if it contains (= (* A B) 0) for
;;; some variables A,B, return a waterfall-disjunction for (:OR (= A 0) (= B 0)).
;;;
;;; Note: If the :all-terms flag is set, then we will perform the above operation for
;;;  zero-products of arbitrary terms.

	  ;; Now, here we need to take care to not destroy a ZP through
	  ;; canonicalization.  If the RHS of an equation is *not* 0, then we
	  ;; need to do the normal LHS := LHS-RHS and canonicalize it.  
	  ;; But, *if* the RHS is already 0, then doing so could destroy the
	  ;; ZP, since canonicalization will always fully multiply all polynomials
	  ;; into a sum-of-monomials form.  Thus, to avoid this, we first check
	  ;; if the RHS of the eq is already 0.  If it is, then we do the following:
	  ;;  (i) If LHS is already a product, then we use it as the ZP.
	  ;; (ii) Else, then we canonicalize LHS, check if the result is a product, 
	  ;;       using it as the ZP if so.
	  ;;
	  ;; For when RHS is non-zero, then we do canonicalization from the start,
	  ;;  as the normal (- LHS RHS) form for the new LHS will never be a product
	  ;;  without simplification.
