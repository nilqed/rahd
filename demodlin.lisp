;;; ORIENT-PARTIAL-LINEQ: Given an equation E containing a linear variable, orient it s.t.
;;;  it is of the form V = P s.t. V is the linear variable in E lowest in the variable 
;;;  in {V, Vars(P)} under the *VARS-TABLE* ordering for the current polynomial ring 
;;;  Q[*VARS-TABLE*] s.t. P does not contain V and RCF |= (V = P) <=> E.
;;;
;;;    For example:  Given the quotient ring Q[z,w,x] (with our DEG-REV-LEX induced
;;;     convention that this means x MO< z, x MO< w, so x is the smallest variable
;;;     in the polynomial ring),
;;;
;;;       5x + 2z - w = 1    would reduce to    x = 1/5 - 2/5 z + 1/5 w.
;;;    
;;;    Likewise, we deal with partially linear equations as well:
;;;
;;;       (= (* 2 (* X X)) (+ (* 3 W) 1))    
;;;
;;;          would reduce to
;;;
;;;       (= W (+ (* 2/3 (* X X)) -1/3)).
;;;
;;; This orientation guarantees we always have terminating directed rewrites.
