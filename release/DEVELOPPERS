[Running RAHD from toplevel]

To load the necessary code:
  (load "rahd")
  (in-package rahd)
  (rahd-reboot)

Once loaded, to attempt to prove a goal automatically:
install GOAL-IN-CNF as top-level goal (0),
  (g 'GOAL-IN-CNF)
invoke the waterfall upon GOAL-IN-CNF,
  (go!)


To wipe your session and begin work on a new proof obligation without rebooting, 
  eval (rahd-reset-state).

To run regression tests:
  (rahd-regression-suite)
